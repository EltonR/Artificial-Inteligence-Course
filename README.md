# Artificial-Inteligence-Course

## Assignment 1: Cannibals and Missionaires Problem
Task 1 of the course.
Informal description: implement a program that solves the Missionaires and Cannibals problem, using a blind search method. Solution should print the states and possible transitions, as well as have a simple animation. Number of cannibals, missionaires and elements on the boat should be parameterized.
A NetBeans project with the solution can be found on the "Canibais_Missionarios" folder.

## Assignment 2: A* algorithm
Task 2 of the course.
Informal description: implement a program that simulates the resolution of a path-finding problem using A\* algorithm. Solution should print the states and possible transitions, as well as the costs of G and H functions on each movement. Als should have a simple animation and the grid size, percentage of obstacles, and starting and target points should be parameterized.
A NetBeans project with the solution can be found on the "Astar" folder.
